## Chapter 5
# 5E1
2 and 4 are multiple regressions because they have more than one beta. 
#5E2
$$\mu_i = \alpha + \beta_{L} L_i + \beta_{D} D_i$$
#5M1
Average monthly ice cream sales is associated with shark attacks. Average monthly temperature is assoicated with shark attacks. Including both in the same model as predictors would eliminate the relationship between ice cream and attacks. 
#5H1
M is conditionally independent from D, given A.
```{R}
data(WaffleDivorce)
df <- WaffleDivorce

# standardize the variables
df$D <- standardize(df$Divorce)
df$A <- standardize(df$MedianAgeMarriage)
df$M <- standardize(df$Marriage)

m.1 <- quap(
  alist(
    # A -> D
    D ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
    mu <- a + bM*M + bA*A,
    a ~ dnorm(0, 0.2),
    bM ~ dnorm(0, 0.5),
    bA ~ dnorm(0, 0.5),
    sigma ~ dexp(1),
    # M -> A
    A ~ dnorm(mu.A, sigma.A),
    mu.A <- a.A + bMA*M,
    a.A ~ dnorm(0, 0.2),
    bMA ~ dnorm(0, 0.5),
    sigma.A ~ dexp(1)
  ), data=df
)

precis(m.1)
plot(coeftab(m.1))
```
Yes, the model is consistent with this causal model.

Question: Do we need a relationship between M and D before conditioning on A?
#5H2
```{R}
M_seq <- seq(from=-2, to=2, length.out=30)
sim_dat <- data.frame(M=M_seq)
s <- sim(m.1, data=sim_dat, vars=c("A","D"))
plot(sim_dat$M, colMeans(s$D), ylim=c(-2,2), type="l", xlab="manipulated A", ylab="counterfactual D")
shade(apply(s$A,2,PI), sim_dat$M)
mtext("Total Counterfactual effect of M on A")
